# CS_250
Week 8
When interrepreting user stories, I have to make sure they are documented and prioritized. When combing through the user stories, I have to see what are similiar and mark them at a higher priority. Lower prioirities should still be added, but can be added later.
Keeping a product backlog will make sure that all user stories are documented. Having a sprint review, daily scrum meetings, and well kept documentation will make sure everything is on track.
Communication is the success of a project. Keeping everyone well informed with project status or roadblocks will help keeping everything on track.
